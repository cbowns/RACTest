# RACTest

RACTest is a very simple ReactiveCocoa-based application so I can learn the framework.

If you're looking for more examples of ReactiveCocoa implementations, I found [Colin Wheeler's ReactiveCocoaPlayground](https://github.com/Machx/Reactive-Cocoa-Playground) to be helpful.

## Usage

`RACTest` uses `ReactiveCocoa` via CocoaPods, so once you [have CocoaPods installed](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), a simple `pod install` should get `ReactiveCocoa` slapped down in the repo.
